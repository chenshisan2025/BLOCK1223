# Quick Start

Goal: **you don’t need to understand Web3 to start**.  
Experience the “aha moment” first, learn wallets and on-chain verification later.

## Step 1: One-click login

- Sign in with **Google / Email** (as shown on the site/app).
- We automatically create your **BW-ID account** to track rewards, referral relationships, and security checks.

## Step 2: Play 60 seconds (BlockRush)

- Our first game is **BlockRush (match-3)**.
- Each run lasts ~60 seconds.
- When you trigger a **5-combo**, you receive a random airdrop of **5–100 BWT**.

## Step 3: Open boxes

You may encounter two different “boxes”:

1) **Mystery Box**  
- Randomly appears during gameplay.  
- May contain **BWT / USDT / NFTs / sponsor tokens / event rewards** (campaign-dependent).

2) **Treasure Box**  
- Every time you **revive using BWT**, you receive **one Treasure Box entry**.  
- Treasure draws happen every **2 hours** (see Treasure Box page).

## Next steps (to increase consistency)

- Get your referral link on the [Referral](./referral.md) page (10% one-level).
- Learn how to verify pools/burn/treasury via the [Transparency](./transparency.md) dashboard.
- Want competition? Read [Leaderboard & Tickets](./leaderboard.md).
