# About BWT

**BWT = the BLOCKWORLD Token.**  
It is the unified unit for sinks, rewards, burn, referrals, and treasury — designed to be transparent and verifiable.

## What can I use BWT for?

### 1) Revive
- Pay **10 BWT** to revive and gain **+30 seconds** (as shown in-app).
- Revive grants a Treasure Box entry and routes part of the spend into Treasure Pool/burn/referral/treasury.

### 2) Endless Ticket
- First Endless run is free daily.
- Additional entries cost **20 BWT** per ticket.

### 3) Item Packs
- Item packs can be used in both modes.
- In Endless Mode: each item type is capped at **5 uses per run**.
- Item pack revenue is partially burned.

## How do I earn BWT?

Common ways:

- 5-combo airdrops (5–100 BWT)
- Mystery Boxes (campaign drops)
- Treasure draws
- Leaderboard settlement
- quests/tasks (if enabled)

## Why on-chain transparency?

Transparency reduces trust friction:

- players can verify pools and burns,
- sponsors can audit delivery,
- investors can perform diligence.
