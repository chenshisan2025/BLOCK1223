# Safety & Fairness

To ensure real players are rewarded, we continuously fight bots and farming.

## Proof-of-Human

We may use a combination of:

- behavioral signals and input patterns,
- Verified Run (log replay),
- device/account risk signals.

## What can trigger risk controls?

- mass signups or device switching,
- unusually high-frequency claims or spending,
- obvious scripted behavior,
- referral abuse.

## Settlement strategy

We may apply:

- delayed settlement for review,
- linear vesting for large rewards,
- disqualification or clawback for confirmed abuse.

## Appeals

If you believe you were incorrectly flagged, submit an appeal via the official support channel (TBD).
