# Referral 10%

Referral is one of our core growth loops. We keep it simple: **one level only**.

## Rate

- **10% one-level referral**

## What spend is covered?

v1.0 typically covers:

- revives,
- Endless tickets,
- item pack purchases,

subject to campaign rules.

## Settlement

- Referrals appear in your dashboard as daily and cumulative amounts.
- On-chain payout visibility will be shown when enabled.

## Anti-fraud

Abnormal behavior (bots, self-referrals, account clusters) may lead to:

- delayed settlement,
- cancellation of referral rewards.
