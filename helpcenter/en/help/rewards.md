# Rewards Overview

BLOCKWORLD’s rewards are composed of: **gameplay airdrops, boxes, pools, and sponsor campaigns**.

## 1) 5-combo airdrop (BlockRush)

When you trigger a **5-combo** in match-3:

- Airdrop amount: **5–100 BWT (random)**
- No fixed guarantee per run

## 2) Mystery Box

- Randomly appears during gameplay.
- May contain **BWT / USDT / NFTs / sponsor tokens / event rewards** (campaign-dependent).
- The Mystery Box is designed to create a strong “dopamine moment” for first-time users.

## 3) Treasure Box

- Every **BWT revive** grants **one Treasure Box entry**.
- Treasure draws happen every **2 hours** (see Treasure Box page).

## 4) Leaderboard Pool

- Part of Endless ticket revenue is routed into the leaderboard prize pool.
- Distribution depends on the current leaderboard rules (see Leaderboard page).

## Where do rewards come from?

Typically from a combination of:

- user-spend pools (Treasure Pool, Leaderboard Pool),
- sponsor budgets (projects, exchanges, brands),
- platform campaign budgets.

> Reminder: rewards are promotional and subject to risk controls, eligibility checks, and regional restrictions. Key flows are verifiable via the Transparency Dashboard.
