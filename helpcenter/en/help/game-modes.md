# Game Modes

BLOCKWORLD currently offers **Story Mode** and **Endless Mode**. They share the same token economy but have different limits.

## Story Mode

Designed for learning and casual progression.

- **Revive**: when time runs out, you may pay **10 BWT** to revive and gain **+30 seconds**.
- **Item packs**: usable in Story Mode.
- **Item usage**: typically **unlimited** in Story Mode (as shown in-app).
- **Risk controls**: for fairness, the system may enforce reasonable per-run limits or trigger review for abnormal behavior.

## Endless Mode

Designed for competition and leaderboard play.

- **First run free daily**.
- Additional runs on the same day require a **20 BWT ticket**.
- **Revive limit**: up to **5 revives** per run.
- **Item limit**: each item type up to **5 uses** per run.

## Why casual games first?

We intentionally start with low-barrier casual gameplay to:

- bring in **Web2-scale** players,
- avoid forcing wallets / chain concepts upfront,
- create trust through **rewards + transparency + fairness** within 60 seconds,
- then complete education through withdrawal flows and on-chain verification.

## Content roadmap

We plan to **launch 1 game and tease 1 next game** (e.g., BlockRush now, a shooter game next) to reduce single-game lifecycle risk and accumulate core assets at the platform layer.
