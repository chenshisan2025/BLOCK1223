# FAQ

## Can I withdraw?
Whether withdrawals are enabled, thresholds, and fees depend on the current product version and region. When enabled, you’ll see your withdrawable balance and on-chain records in your dashboard.

## Do I need a wallet?
No. You can start with Google/email. If you withdraw or join deeper on-chain campaigns, the product will guide you.

## Where do rewards come from?
A combination of user-spend pools, sponsor budgets, and platform campaign budgets, with key flows intended to be verifiable on-chain.

## Why didn’t I get a Mystery Box?
Mystery Boxes are random and campaign-dependent. Check “Today’s Drops” or campaign announcements.

## How is referral calculated?
10% one-level on eligible spend (revive/ticket/items). Risk controls can delay or cancel referral payouts.

## How do Treasure draws work?
Every 2 hours: 50% to a random Lucky 100, 50% shared among remaining holders.

## How can I verify the splits?
Use the Transparency Dashboard and Tx feed, and check the corresponding on-chain transactions.
