# Treasure Box (2-hour draws)

Treasure Box is our core “emotion layer”: it turns revives from pure spend into a participation right — with fully transparent token flow.

## How do I get a Treasure Box?

- Every time you **revive using BWT**, you receive **1 Treasure Box entry**.

## Revive split (10 BWT)

For each **10 BWT** revive:

- **50%** -> **Treasure Pool**
- **30%** -> **Burn** (black hole address)
- **10%** -> **Referral** (one-level)
- **10%** -> **Treasury**

All splits are intended to be visible on-chain and visualized on the Transparency Dashboard.

## Draw schedule

- **One draw every 2 hours**.

## Distribution per round

Let the pool for the round be `P` (BWT):

1) **Lucky 100**  
- **50% (0.5P)** is distributed to **100 randomly selected** players.

2) **Holder Share**  
- The remaining **50% (0.5P)** is split equally among all other Treasure Box holders in that round.

## Risk controls and settlement

For fairness and security:

- suspicious accounts may be delayed or disqualified,
- large rewards may be subject to delayed settlement or linear vesting (as defined in Official Rules).
